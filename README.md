## 🤝 1. About

This is a **fully open-source, daily-updated** crypto market research project.
 We blend **global macro liquidity** (central-bank liquidity, dollar dynamics, fiscal pulse, etc.) with **crypto microstructure** (volume, flows, volatility, price structure) into a coherent, reviewable output — two flavors:

1. **Market Overview** (free): a bird’s-eye flow from **macro → on-chain bridge → market structure**
2. **Single-Asset Deep-Dive**: multi-timeframe (W/D/H4) + dimension scoring + key levels + scenario framing

Our vibe is **open-minded**, cross-disciplinary, and decentralized. We love rigorous evidence chains but keep the reading experience human. We respect statistics and unified “rule-of-thumb” **calibration**, while acknowledging narrative and reflexivity. We believe **open methods + clear conclusions** beat “mystery sauce” in a volatile world.

------

## 🎯 2. Who Is This For

- 📈 **Traders / quants** seeking a fast alignment of *macro ↔ market*
- 🔗 **Web3 / DeFi participants** who want daily structural snapshots & key-level heat
- 🔭 **Tech / finance observers** interested in how liquidity and on-chain flows transmit to prices
- 🤔 **Curious humans** — zero-barrier reading; learn the “why,” step by step

> We don’t offer investment advice. We offer **verifiable analysis and frameworks** to help you form your own view.

------

## 🧪 3. Methodology

Core recipe: **Multi-Timeframe (W/D/H4) × Macro Injection × Structured Scoring**.
 In one line: **Fix the “environment” first, read the “structure” second, time the “pace” last.**

### 3.1 Multi-Timeframe (W/D/H4)

- **Weekly (W)**: big-cycle posture and structural backdrop
- **Daily (D)**: mid-cycle state and inflection checks
- **4-hour (H4)**: execution rhythm and alignment tests

> **HTF Gate**: W/D decide the baseline; H4 only aligns/refines rhythm. If W and D disagree, **D leads execution**, **W biases direction**.

### 3.2 Macro Injection

We inject the **“water level”** of the environment into technical reading:

- Track **central-bank & fiscal liquidity** (RRP/TGA/reserves), **DXY**, **rates** to describe **MWI** (macro water index) and **NL7** (net 7-day injections/withdrawals).
- Add the **stablecoin bridge** (e.g., **SMR** share, **CUE** capital-use efficiency, **SLP** 7-day net issuance) to judge **macro → on-chain → market** transmission quality & lag.
- If macro and bridge align, **raise confidence**; if they diverge, **lower confidence**. (Divergence ≠ instant reversal; think **drag/lag**.)

### 3.3 Structured Scoring (comparable across time)

We break the market into consistent dimensions:

- **Price structure & patterns** (key levels, completion/validation of structures)
- **MA system** (20/50/200 positions, slopes, golden/death crosses)
- **Momentum** (MACD zero-axis & bars; RSI zones & divergences)
- **Flows** (OBV/CMF directionality & persistence)
- **Trend strength** (DMI/ADX organizational clarity)
- **Volatility & location** (ATR/nATR, KC band positioning: mid/upper/lower/outside)
- **Multi-TF resonance** (W/D/H4 alignment; volume-backed reclaim/loss of key MAs)

> **Note**: README outlines **framework & calibration only**. We keep weights, rule conflicts, and some thresholds in code/internal docs and iterate. Our priority: **evidence chains + unified wording**, not esoteric parameters.

### 3.4 Output & Visualization

- **One-screen glance**: core verdict + 3–5 hard evidence bullets + a micro macro-transmission sentence
- **Tables**: unified snapshot of indicators based on the **last closed candle only**
- **Emoji cues**: 🟢 (pro-bull) | 🔴 (pro-bear) | 🟡 (neutral/range) for fast scanning
