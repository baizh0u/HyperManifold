## Key Conclusions

* **Market State**: ⚪ Range-bound
* **Market Bias (FYI)**: ⚪ Range - Awaiting Confirmation
* **Confidence**: 59% ｜ **Composite Score**: 15/100
* **Status Badge**: 🟢 Bullish MA Alignment｜⚪ Clear Trend｜🔴 In Pullback｜⚪ Volatility High Bias

**One-sentence Summary**  
Currently in a phase where a strong weekly, unbroken bullish structure overlaps a daily pullback and 4-hour mean reversion. Evidence: 1) Daily 20/50/200 MA bullish alignment, price is +41.78% above 200-day MA; 2) Daily close below 20-day MA (-6.10%) with negative MACD histogram shrinking (above zero line) — short momentum skewed bearish; 3) Daily trend strength (ADX) = 29, -DI dominance aligns with break below mid-KC, organized pullback; 4) 4H OBV crossing above its 9-period EMA, price between KC lower and mid bands, rhythm leaning mean reversion; 5) Weekly still in strong phase (+DI well above -DI, positive money flow, volume ratio > 2). Macro transmission: MWI = -1.8 (tight bias, score -2), stablecoin bridge (SMR ≈ 8.14%, CUE ≈ 18%) robust, net inflow ≈ $0.30B last 3 days (annualized ≈ +$0.7B) but NL7 position negative, overall transmission efficiency +7 yet short-term capped by fiscal drain.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission One-liner**  
MWI = -1.8 (tight bias, score -2), NL7 average +$25.25B but position -$44.32B, strong fiscal drain via TGA, RRP decline, reserves average rising; stablecoin bridge healthy (SMR ≈ 8.14% abundant, CUE ≈ 18% efficient, ≈$0.30B net inflow over 3 days), annualized inflow neutral-to-slightly-positive (≈+$0.7B) but below strong threshold, zero net impact on market confidence, short-term more impacted by position drain.

## Technical Dimension Scores  
Currently “Strong Weekly, Unbroken Bullish Structure” backdrop; daily pullback (closing below 20-day MA, MACD histogram negative/shrinking), trend strength high (ADX ≈ 29, -DI dominant), 4H within KC lower-to-mid band, OBV cross above shows marginal capital inflow & rhythm repair. MA system intact (20>50>200 bullish alignment), 200-day MA rising, structure intact. Volatility: 4H normalized volatility ≈ 3.13%, slightly above healthy zone; short-term elasticity with noise.

| Dimension         | Score   | Key Evidence (Thresholds & Numbers) |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Price Structure  | -4/13  | Price above 200D MA & MA20/50 rising → +3; twice broke below mid-KC/failed reclaim MA20 → -4; Daily bearish engulf (10-17, vol ratio 1.25) → -3 |
| MA System        | 12/20  | MA20>MA50>MA200 all rising → +8; Price above 200D & 200D rising → +4 |
| Momentum         | -6/18  | Daily MACD above zero but hist negative/shrinking → -4; RSI14=47.89 in neutral low → -2 |
| Capital Flow     | -2/15  | 4H OBV > EMA9 → +3; Daily OBV < EMA9 → -3; CMF21=0.0936 positive → +2 |
| Trend Strength   | 6/10   | ADX=29 > 25 trend → +3; -DI dominance aligning with pullback → +3 |
| Volatility & Position | 1/5 | 4H nATR ≈ 3.13% slightly high; KC lower-mid band → +1 |
| Multi-timeframe Resonance | 3/7 | Weekly strong bias; 4H holds 200MA with repair → +3 |

**Dimension Breakdown**  

* Price Structure: Daily still bullish macro (above 200D MA), but short-term pullback below 20D MA and bearish engulf (10-17, below mid-KC), followed by inside bar (10-18) consolidation; short-term structure tilted bearish.  
* MA System: 20/50/200 bullish alignment, 200D rising, clear long-term support; pullback intact above 50/200 MAs.  
* Momentum: MACD above zero but hist negative/shrinking — repair incomplete; RSI14 at lower neutral zone, weak short-term.  
* Capital Flow: Daily OBV below 9EMA (pressure), 4H OBV cross above, CMF positive — marginal inflow repair signs.  
* Trend Strength: ADX high (≈29), -DI > +DI consistent with organized pullback.  
* Volatility: 4H normalized vol slightly high (≈3.13%), price within KC lower-mid zone suggests mean reversion probability.  
* Multi-timeframe Resonance: Weekly strong bias intact, 4H holding above its 200MA with repair signal, alignment neutral-to-bullish; daily dominates execution (pullback phase), waiting to reclaim 20D/mid-KC.

**Conflict Note**: When weekly strong & daily pullback diverge, daily guides execution (short-term bearish pullback); 4H only reflects rhythm repair; weekly defines directional bias (medium-term still bullish).

## Forward Scenarios

**Scenario ①: Continue Upward**  
If technical/macro align, price leans toward mean reversion to mid-band and test R2.

| Factor     | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Probability | 30%   |
| Window      | 3–5 days |
| Trigger (Technical) | IF: Daily close > R1 (1139.38) AND 4H OBV > EMA9 AND Daily MACD hist converging to zero |
| Trigger (Macro) | IF: SLP7d > +$1B OR DXY < 120; OR MWI > +3 & Transmission efficiency > 0 |
| Target/Range | 1163–1208 |
| Invalidation | Daily close < S1 OR 4H close < 4H 200MA (1094.42) |

**Scenario ②: Range-bound**  
Daily consolidates between S1 and R1, momentum repairs.

| Factor     | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Probability | 45%   |
| Window      | 1–2 weeks |
| Trigger (Technical) | IF: S1 (1068) < Daily close < R1 (1139) AND ADX (14) < 30 |
| Trigger (Macro) | No strong macro trigger |
| Target/Range | 1068–1139 |
| Invalidation | Break above R1 & hold mid-band/20D MA, OR break below S1 with volume & -DI expansion > +10 |

**Scenario ③: Turn Bearish**  
If repair fails, short-term pullback extends to lower daily supports.

| Factor     | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Probability | 25%   |
| Window      | 2–3 days |
| Trigger (Technical) | IF: 4H close < 4H 200MA (1094.42) AND 4H MACD hist turns negative & expands; Daily close stays below KC mid band |
| Trigger (Macro) | IF: SLP7d weakens (<+$0.5B) OR DXY strengthens further; NL7 position negative consecutively |
| Target/Range | 1068–1021 |
| Invalidation | 4H close back above 4H 20MA (1104.39) & OBV > EMA9 ｜ Daily holds above R1 (1139.38) |

---

## Risk Alerts

1. Weak trend phase (daily pullback) has high risk of false breakouts & band-out volatility noise.  
2. Short-term macro-technical divergence (NL7 drain vs on-chain net inflow) — directional signals need confirmation.

---

## Watch List (for next day/next period review)

- **Volatility**: H4 nATR staying in healthy 1–3% zone (Current: 3.13% → ⚪ High bias).  
- **Momentum**: D RSI14 exiting neutral 40–60 zone (Current: 47.89 → ⚪ Neutral); MACD zero line/hist (Current: above zero/shrinking → 🔴 Bear bias).  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs EMA9 relationship (cross above), check price-volume alignment.  
- **MA Structure**: D ΔMA20/50/200 expanding/contracting (-6.10% / 6.82% / 41.78%).  
- **Key Levels**: Watch S1/R1 triggers & invalidation conditions (from “Price Level Position & Relative Distance”).

## Comparison with Yesterday: Change Attribution

**Composite Changes**

* Composite Score: Insufficient data (no prior report) → 15 (Δ N/A)  
* State Tag: Insufficient data (no prior report) → Range-bound (Hold/Await confirmation)  
* Confidence: Insufficient data (no prior report) → 59% (Δ N/A)  
* Core Driver: Based on current report, daily pullback coexists with 4H repair; macro position drain capping short-term RP.

**Dimension Score Changes & Drivers**

| ---------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Macro Liquidity | N/A | -2  | N/A | MWI -1.8 (tight) |
| Transmission Efficiency | N/A | 7   | N/A | SMR abundant/CUE efficient, SLP annualized neutral |
| Structure  | N/A | -4  | N/A | Break below mid-KC & bearish engulf |
| MA System  | N/A | 12  | N/A | Bullish alignment with 200D MA rising |
| Momentum   | N/A | -6  | N/A | MACD hist negative/shrinking, RSI neutral low |
| Capital Flow | N/A | -2 | N/A | 4H OBV cross above but daily OBV still weak |
| Trend Strength | N/A | 6   | N/A | ADX high, -DI dominant |

| Multi-timeframe Resonance | N/A | 3   | N/A | Weekly strong, 4H holds MA200 & repairs |

**Top Changing Metrics (≤10)**

1. Daily MACD hist: -19.54 → -23.04 (shrinking) ｜ Conclusion: Repair incomplete, bearish bias.  
2. Daily RSI14: 51.64 → 47.89 (drop) ｜ Conclusion: Pullback phase, neutral-to-weak.  
3. Daily price vs 20D MA: Above → Below (-6.10%) ｜ Conclusion: Short-term bearish bias.  
4. H4 OBV vs EMA9: Below → Cross above ｜ Conclusion: Marginal capital inflow.  
5. H4 KC zone: Near mid → Lower to mid ｜ Conclusion: Mean reversion bias.

**Pattern & Key Level Changes**

* Pattern: Daily bearish engulf (10-17) followed by inside bar consolidation (10-18).  
* Key Levels: R1/mid-KC contested repeatedly; S1 (1068) now key short-term watch.

**Macro Transmission Efficiency Changes**

* Yesterday: N/A  
* Today: MWI -1.8, SLP annualized ≈ +$0.7B, composite score 15 → Neutral-to-positive transmission but disturbed by position drain.  
* Impact: Confidence ±0% (unchanged).
