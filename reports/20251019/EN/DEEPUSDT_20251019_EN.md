## Key Conclusions

* **Market Status**: ⚪ Range-bound
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ⚪ Range, Awaiting Confirmation
* **Confidence**: 66% ｜ **Composite Score**: -31/100
* **Status Badges**: 🔴 Bearish Alignment 🔴 Strong Trend ⚪ High Volatility 🔴 Weak Capital Flow

**One-Sentence Summary**  
The current daily price is significantly below the 20/50/200-day moving averages (about -28.37% deviation from MA20 and -42.13% from MA200), with momentum and trend {{BEAR:bearish}}: MACD is below the zero axis with a bearish cross, RSI(14)=33.06 in the weak zone, and ADX=40.21 shows an organized downtrend with +DI/-DI aligned to the downside. On 10-10, a {{BEAR:bearish engulfing}} appeared with a volume ratio ≈3.05 (significant increase), followed by sustained weakness. The 4H chart rebounded back above the KC midline but still stayed under the 50/200-day MAs—short-term correction without changing the mid-term downtrend. On the macro side, MWI=-1.8 (tight), but stablecoin bridge transmission efficiency score is +7/10 (SMR≈8.14%, CUE≈18%), offering some offsetting support to price; Considering the contradiction between NL7 weekend draining and negative technical score, the overall conclusion is range-bound bearish, awaiting confirmation at key levels.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission One-Sentence Summary**  
MWI=-1.8 (tight), NL7 average ≈+$25.25B (net injection) but Wednesday point ≈-$44.32B (net drain); stablecoin supply net increase ≈+$0.30B over the past 3 days, SMR≈8.14% in ample range, CUE≈18% shows high capital usage efficiency. Overall: macro liquidity is tight but {{BULL:acceptable}} via stablecoin bridge transmission; limited offset to weak technicals, with slightly positive confidence adjustment.

## Technical Dimension Scoring

Current weekly bearish (daily dominant), 4H short-term rebound but not aligned. Daily price far below 20/50/200 MAs, MACD below zero axis with bearish cross, RSI in weak zone, DMI/ADX showing organized downtrend. Volume-price: 10-10 downward with significant volume; OBV below its 9-day EMA; CMF(21) mostly negative lately. Position & volatility: H4 nATR≈4.52% above healthy range, short-term in KC mid to upper band but still under 50/200 MAs.

| Dimension       | Score    | Key Evidence (Threshold-based, may include values)         |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Structure & Pattern | -8/13 | Daily far below MA200; 10-10 formed {{BEAR:Bearish Engulfing}} (volume ratio ≈3.05) → Structure -8 |
| MA System       | -8/20    | MA20<MA50<MA200 (bearish alignment); price below MA200 → -8 |
| Momentum Indicators | -11/18 | MACD below zero with {{BEAR:Bearish Cross}} (-3); bar expanding bearish; RSI14=33.06<40 → -8~11 |
| Capital Flow    | -8/15    | 10-10 bearish with high volume (-5); OBV below 9-day EMA (-3); CMF(21)=-0.027 → -8 |
| Trend Strength  | +10/10   | ADX=40.21>25 and rising (+6); -DI dominant and aligned to downside (+4) → +10 |
| Volatility & Position | -1/5 | H4 nATR≈4.52% above healthy range; near KC midline (neutral) → -1 |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | -3/7 | Weekly/daily bearish; 4H below its MA200 (not aligned) → -3 |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Pattern: Recently formed {{BEAR:Bearish Engulfing}} (10-10), with price staying below 20/50/200-day MAs, bearish structure; recent swing low (0.0754 on 10-17) not yet recovered.
* MA System: {{BEAR:Bearish Alignment}} (20<50<200), price under MA200, moving averages sloping down, indicating mid-term weakness.
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero axis with bearish cross, negative bars; RSI(14)=33.06 in weak zone, momentum and trend resonating bearish.
* Capital Flow: 10-10 high-volume drop; OBV below 9-day EMA; CMF(21) mostly negative, insufficient capital confirmation.
* Trend Strength: ADX>40 shows strong downtrend organization, -DI dominant and aligned to price direction, clear trend phase.
* Volatility & Position: H4 nATR>3% (high volatility), price between KC mid and upper bands, neutral position with correction bias; beware of false rebounds under high volatility.
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Weekly/daily bearish, 4H above midline but still suppressed by MAs, no HTF alignment.

**Conflict Explanation**: Short-term 4H rebound (OBV above EMA, KC midline above) conflicts with daily/weekly bearish bias; under “follow higher timeframe” rule, daily dominates, 4H only watched for rhythm corrections.
