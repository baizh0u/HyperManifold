**One-Sentence Summary**  
Daily chart closed below the 200-day MA for two consecutive days, trend strength indicator >30 with negative dominance; 4H chart in lower half of channel under MA pressure, dense resistance above. The downtrend is accompanied by increased volume and weaker capital momentum; rebounds mainly serve to confirm resistance.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission One-Sentence Summary**  
MWI=-2.7 (tight), NL7≈-$44.3B (net withdrawal); Treasury TGA rises sharply, absorbing liquidity, positive effect from falling RRP offset. Stablecoin buffer ratio (SMR) at 8.21% (ample), but capital utilization efficiency (CUE) is significantly negative and slightly net increased over the past 3 days, transmission is weak, pressure on market risk appetite, confidence adjustment to neutral-to-negative.

## Technical Dimension Scoring

Weekly chart still above long-term uptrend channel, but past four weeks volume and capital slope weaken; daily chart since 10-17 closed below 200-day MA, high trend strength, -DI dominance, organized bearish progression. 4H chart shows clear MA bearish suppression, in lower half of channel, short-term rebounds mainly test resistance, no structural reversal signal yet.

| Dimension              | Score  | Key Evidence (Threshold-based, may have specific values) |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| Price Structure & Pattern | -7/13 | Daily closes below 200-day MA for two days (10-17/10-18) = “Effective Break” ×2 → -4; Price in lower half of channel → -3 |
| MA System           | -6/20 | Daily price below 200-day MA (-0.39%); 20-day MA recent slope negative → Structure weakening |
| Momentum Indicators | -8/18 | MACD below zero axis and expanding (-1504.33, slightly up from -1513.95 but still negative); RSI14=36.74 below 40 → Bearish Momentum |
| Capital Flow        | -6/15 | Downtrend with increased volume (10-10 vol ratio ≈3.04); Daily OBV below its MA without repair; CMF>0 but insufficient lift → Weak capital confirmation |
| Trend Strength      | -8/10 | ADX=33.79>25 and rising, -DI significantly above +DI (38.10 vs 13.62), aligned with price → Trend Down |
| Volatility & Position | +1/5 | 4H nATR≈1.32% in healthy range, price in lower half of channel → Neutral-to-Healthy |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | -5/7 | Weekly neutral, Daily bearish, 4H same direction bearish and below respective MAs → Downside Alignment |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Pattern: Daily closed below 200-day MA for two days, short-term structure confirmed downside; last 10 candles show no typical reversal, trend progression overall.  
* MA System: Long-term bullish still intact, but short/medium MAs slope negative and price below 200-day MA, rebounds face MA resistance.  
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero axis and expanding, RSI below 40 in weak zone, no momentum recovery.  
* Capital Flow: Declines with higher volume, OBV below MA, CMF positive but not rising persistently, price-volume alignment bearish.  
* Trend Strength: ADX>30 and -DI dominant, trend “organized” downward, rebounds should watch for weakening signals.  
* Volatility & Position: 4H volatility healthy, running in lower half of channel, more “weak rebound—then selection” pacing.  
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Weekly as bias reference, Daily and 4H aligned downtrend; short-term follow downside, upside needs reclaim of key MAs.

**Conflict Explanation**: Weekly long-term trend still in high channel, but Daily/4H clearly weakened; execution mainly on Daily/4H, waiting for Weekly/Daily re-alignment confirmation.

## Future Scenario Analysis

**Scenario ①: Continued Uptrend (Weak Recovery)**  
If the daily 200-day MA is reclaimed and held, short-term may recover to channel mid axis.

| Element      | Content |
| -------- | ---- |
| Probability | 20% |
| Expected Window | 3–5 Days |
| Technical Trigger | If: Daily Close > R1(107606) and 4H OBV above its MA and sustained; 4H Close ≥ 4H 20-period MA |
| Macro Trigger | If: Stablecoin 7d net > +$1B or DXY drops below 120; or MWI > +3 and Transmission score > 0 |
| Target/Range | 111,800 – 113,700 |
| Invalidation | 4H Close < 4H 20-period MA or Daily loses 200-day MA again |

**Scenario ②: Range Consolidation (Weak)**  
Oscillating between S1 and R1, trend strength drops before choosing direction.

| Element      | Content |
| -------- | ---- |
| Probability | 35% |
| Expected Window | 1–2 Weeks |
| Technical Trigger | If: S1 < Daily Close < R1 and ADX < 20 |
| Macro Trigger | No strong macro trigger |
| Target/Range | 105,000 – 108,000 |
| Invalidation | Break above R1 or below S1, or ADX>25 and -DI/+DI gap >10 |

**Scenario ③: Weakness Continuation (Trend)**  
Maintain downtrend, break near support then expand downward.

| Element      | Content |
| -------- | ---- |
| Probability | 45% |
| Expected Window | 2–3 Days |
| Technical Trigger | If: 4H Close < 4H 50-period MA and MACD bars continuously expand negatively; Daily Close remains below 200-day MA |
| Macro Trigger | If: SLP weakens or DXY continues strength |
| Target/Range | 103,600 – 105,000 |
| Invalidation | 4H Close > 4H 20-period MA and OBV > MA ｜ Daily holds R1 |

## Risk Warnings

1. In trend strengthening phase (ADX>30), false rebound and false breakout risk increases.  
2. Macro and technical might diverge short-term (SMR ample but CUE negative), need to watch fiscal spending pace and marginal changes in USD strength.

## Monitoring Checklist (For next day/period review)

- **Volatility**: H4 nATR stays in 1–3% healthy band (Current: 1.32% → ⚪ Healthy).  
- **Momentum**: D RSI14 exits 40–60 neutral band (Current: 36.74 → 🔴 Weak); MACD bar direction and zero axis (Current: below zero/expanding → 🔴 Bearish).  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs MA relationship (Above), check price-volume alignment.  
- **MA Structure**: D ΔMA20/50/200 continues widening (-7.81% / -6.09% / -0.39%).  
- **Key Levels**: Watch if S1/R1 triggers or invalidation conditions are met.
