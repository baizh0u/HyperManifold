## Core Conclusion

* **Market Status**: ⚪ Range-Bound
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ⚪ Sideways, Awaiting Confirmation
* **Confidence**: 61% ｜ **Composite Score**: -9/100
* **Status Badges**: ⚪ Bullish Alignment (Daily MAs still in bull trend) ｜ 🔴 Weakening Momentum (MACD below zero + RSI low) ｜ ⚪ Neutral-to-Inflow (CMF>0) ｜ ⚪ Healthy Volatility

**One-Sentence Summary**  
Currently in a weak range-bound phase: Daily price near the 200-day MA, MA system remains bullish but momentum has weakened significantly (MACD below zero axis and histogram contracting, RSI14≈36.7). Trend strength (ADX≈33–35) shows downward organization still present; 4H has rebounded above the 20 MA but remains below the 50/200. Evidence: 1) Daily close at 107,185, below 20/50 MAs and slightly under 200 MA; 2) MACD below zero with histogram contraction over the past 2 days; 3) RSI14 dropped out of the 40–60 neutral zone into weak territory; 4) OBV below its MA but CMF > 0.05—price/volume/funds not fully in sync; 5) H4 nATR≈1.32%, healthy volatility, price near KC midline. Macro read in brief: MWI≈-1.8 (tight bias, macro score -2) but stablecoin-side SMR>8%, CUE high (≈18%), bridge quality strong; NL7 current point negative but average positive, transmission efficiency neutral-to-positive (score +5), neutral impact on technical confidence.

## Technical Dimension Scoring
Multi-timeframe shows: Weekly still above 50/200-week MAs (bullish structure) but MACD histogram negative, RSI neutral — “upper structure + slowing momentum”; Daily near 200-day MA and below 20/50, momentum and trend strength both weakening (MACD below zero, RSI dropped to weak zone, ADX>30 with -DI leading), fund flows not fully bearish (OBV weak, CMF positive); 4H short-term rebound above 20 MA, OBV above MA, healthy volatility but still below 50/200 MAs — no aligned breakout. Overall weak range-bound, awaiting key level confirmation.

| Dimension      | Score   | Key Evidence (thresholds, with values)               |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Structure & Patterns | -2/13 | Daily below 20/50 and near 200 MA (ΔMA20=-7.80%, ΔMA50=-6.12%, ΔMA200=-0.39%); No strong reversal in past 2 days (only 10–11 “inside” consolidation) |
| MA System      | +6/20   | MA20>MA50>MA200 bullish order; Price above 200 MA (last_closed just under, latest above), near-term MA20 slope weakening → mild positive |
| Momentum       | -8/18   | MACD below zero and contracting histogram (-1504→-1514), RSI14=36.74 dropped from neutral → bearish |
| Fund Flows     | +2/15   | OBV below MA (weak confirmation) but CMF21=0.099>0.05 (inflow) maintained → neutral-to-positive |
| Trend Strength | -4/10   | ADX≈33–35 (clear trend), -DI leading with price direction (down) → scored negative |
| Volatility & Position | +1/5 | H4 nATR≈1.32% in healthy zone; KC position “lower band to midline” → neutral mild positive |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | -2/7 | Weekly bullish vs Daily weak; H4 rebound not above 50/200 → inconsistent, mild negative |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Patterns: Daily in “break below 20/50 and near 200” repair/divergence zone; no strong reversal patterns like morning star or engulfing, only Oct 10–11 inside bar consolidation, weak structure awaiting confirmation.
* MA System: 20>50>200 bullish remains, but near-term MA20 slope weakening; price oscillating around 200-day MA, prone to “mean reversion — re-selection.”
* Momentum: MACD below zero, RSI14 in 36–39 range, short-term momentum led by bears; watch for histogram expansion or further contraction to gauge repair pace.
* Fund Flows: OBV not confirmed above MA, but CMF stays >0.05, chain funds not showing large outflows — some buffer against price drops.
* Trend Strength: ADX>30 with -DI leading indicates downward organization; if +DI improves and price reclaims 20/50, negative score would ease.
* Volatility & Position: H4 volatility within healthy range (1–3%), price near KC midline — likely to mean-revert within range.
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Weekly bullish, Daily weak, 4H rebound not breaking — no full alignment.

**Conflict Resolution**: When Weekly bullish but Daily weak, Daily takes execution lead; 4H rebound not breaking above 50/200 — weekly bullish repair signal not weighted.

## Price Levels & Relative Distance (based on last_closed)

- **Close vs MA20/50/200 (D, last_closed)**:  
  Price below 20/50 and 200-day MAs (latest unclosed just above); Deviations: -7.80% / -6.12% / -0.39%.
- **KC Position (H4, last_closed)**:  
  Lower band to midline (Interpretation: outside bands=overextension; midline=↑ mean-reversion probability).
- **Support/Resistance Heatmap (Daily focus)**:  
  Combining MA system, near pivots & KC midline/boundaries:
  - Supports: KC lower band (≈105,027), 200-day MA (≈107,606), 10-17 low (≈103,528)
  - Resistances: KC midline (≈113,658), 50-day MA (≈114,171), 20-day MA (≈116,285)

**Reminder (Non-Advice)**: Watch “close above/lose” S2 (200-day MA) and R1 (KC midline); effective break above/below either will shift short-term rhythm.

## Forward Scenarios

**Scenario①: Continued Upside**  
If daily close > R1 (113,658) and 4H OBV ≥ its MA and maintained, short-term could revisit 20/50-day MA zone.

## Risk Alerts

1. In weak trend phase, false breakout risk high (ADX elevated but +DI insufficient).
2. Macro & technical signals diverge (NL7 point drain vs mild stablecoin inflow) — direction signals need key close confirmation.

**Pattern & Key Level Changes**

* Pattern: No new strong reversal (morning star/engulfing), “inside consolidation” remains  
* Key Levels: S2 (200-day MA) & R1 (KC midline) are rhythm dividers; currently closer to S2

**Macro Transmission Efficiency Changes**

* Today: MWI -1.8, SLP≈+0.7 (weekly est), market score -9 → transmission neutral-to-positive (bridge quality high but point drain)  
* Impact: Confidence +5% (macro aligned but weak)
