## Core Conclusion

* **Market Status**: ⚪ Range-bound  
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ⚪ Waiting for Range Confirmation  
* **Confidence Level**: 60% ｜ **Composite Score**: -10/100  
* **Status Badges**: ⚪ Weak Trend ⚪ Diverging Volume  

**One-Sentence Summary**  
Recently, SOL remains above the 200-day MA on the daily chart but has broken below the 20/50-day MAs, indicating weak momentum; capital flow is neutral with a slight bullish bias. On the 4H chart, OBV has crossed above with nATR in the healthy zone, showing signs of short-term stabilization but no multi-timeframe alignment. Key evidence: 1) Daily MACD below the zero axis with a bearish crossover, RSI14 ≈ 42 (weak bias); 2) +DI < -DI, ADX ≈ 23 (weak trend); 3) CMF21 ≈ 0.09 (capital inflow) but insufficient daily bullish volume (relative volume ≈ 0.43); 4) 4H OBV above EMA9 (short-term capital cooperation), price between KC midline and upper band; 5) Price still above 200-day MA, bullish engulfing pattern on 10-12 near long-term support. Macro transmission one-liner: MWI = -1.8 (tight bias, macro score -2), NL7 average is positive but weekend readings negative, stablecoin weekly net inflow ≈ +$0.7B, transmission efficiency +5/10; medium-term transmission acceptable, short-term affected by liquidity drains.

**Macro Transmission One-Liner Summary**  
MWI = -1.8 (tight macro bias, score -2/12); NL7 average ≈ +$25.25B but Wed reading ≈ -$44.32B, TGA surge drains short-term liquidity; stablecoins weekly net inflow ≈ +$0.7B, SMR ≈ 8.14%, CUE ≈ 18% indicate ample on-chain "ammo" and high efficiency; transmission efficiency +5/10, confidence bias neutral-positive.

## Technical Dimension Scoring
Large timeframe bias (weekly/daily): Weekly price above main MAs but ADX ≈ 16 (weak trend); daily above 200-day MA but below 20/50-day MAs; MACD below zero axis with bearish crossover, weak short-mid momentum; past week near 200-day MA saw bullish engulfing & hammer patterns (near long-term support); CMF positive but volume not confirmed. 4H execution: OBV crossed above, price above KC midline, nATR in healthy zone; short-term stabilization but no same-direction breakout with daily chart.

| Dimension      | Score   | Key Evidence (Thresholded, may include values)             |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Structure/Patterns | +2/13 | Daily above 200-day MA; 10-12 bullish engulfing & rel vol > 1.3 (+2); 10-17 hammer near 200-day MA (+1), but still below 20/50-day MA (-1 offset) |
| Moving Average System   | 0/20   | MA20 < MA50 but not full bearish arrangement; price above 200-day MA (no score due to missing MA200 slope); golden/death cross timing data missing |
| Momentum Indicators     | -6/18  | MACD below zero & bearish cross (-3); histogram expanding below zero (-3); RSI14 = 41.58 in neutral zone lower bound (-1 included in composite) |
| Capital Flow            | +1/15  | Daily CMF21 = 0.0901 > 0 (+3); but bullish vol ≈ 0.43 (-2); H4 OBV above EMA9 (+2, downweighted to +1 for 4H) |
| Trend Strength          | -3/10  | Daily ADX ≈ 23.34 (<25, weak trend); -DI dominant & aligned with price direction (bearish, -2); Weekly ADX ≈ 16 (not strong trend) |
| Volatility/Position     | +1/5   | H4 nATR ≈ 2.78% in healthy 1–3% zone (+1); KC midline to upper band, no outside tail risk (neutral) |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | -2/7   | Daily bearish bias while 4H short-term repair not same-direction breakout (-2); not back above 4H MA50/MA200 (no score) |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure/Patterns: Still in long-term bullish zone (>200-day MA), short-term patterns such as bullish engulfing and hammer near 200-day MA provide support, but upper MA resistance remains.  
* Moving Average System: No bullish arrangement (MA20 < MA50), long-term support valid but lacks slope/cross info.  
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero with bearish crossover, RSI in lower neutral zone; repair not sufficient.  
* Capital Flow: CMF positive, 4H OBV above shows short-term capital cooperation, but daily bullish volume lacking.  
* Trend Strength: ADX below trend threshold, +DI/-DI structure bearish, overall "transition/weak trend".  
* Volatility/Position: nATR in healthy zone, price above KC midline, favorable for orderly repair but requires volume confirmation.  
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Divergence between 4H stabilization and daily bearish bias; wait for daily move above 20-day MA with breakout volume to align.

**Conflict Interpretation**: When daily trend is bearish but 4H shows short-term repair, prioritize daily trend; 4H only used for execution rhythm and alignment check; maintain range view until breakout confirmed.

## Risk Warnings

1. In weak-trend phases, risk of false breakout is high; monitor if volume and OBV align.  
2. Short-term macro and technical decoupling (NL7 negative, stablecoins slightly positive); maintain range-trading mindset without clear directional signal.

---

## Monitoring Checklist (For next day/next session review)

- **Volatility**: Check if H4 nATR stays in 1–3% healthy zone (Current: 2.78% → ⚪ Healthy).  
- **Momentum**: Daily RSI14 breaking out of 40–60 neutral zone (Current: 41.58 → 🔴 Weak); MACD zero axis/histogram (Current: Below Zero / Expanding → 🔴 Bearish).  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs EMA9 (Above), watch if price-volume alignment sustains.  
- **MA Structure**: Daily ΔMA20/50/200 expanding/contracting (-10.49%/-12.93%/+7.63%).  
- **Key Levels**: Watch if triggers/invalidations of S1/R1 are met (See “Key Price Level Analysis”).

| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | Data insufficient | -2 | —      | 4H repair not aligned with daily volume |

**Top Changing Indicators (≤10)**

1. Daily MACD: Below zero axis with stronger bearish cross (Bearish) ｜ Interpretation: Momentum repair not confirmed  
2. Daily RSI14: 41.58 (Lower neutral bound) ｜ Interpretation: Weak zone  
3. Daily CMF21: 0.0901 ｜ Interpretation: Marginal capital inflow  
4. 4H OBV: Cross above EMA9 ｜ Interpretation: Short-term capital cooperation  
5. 4H nATR: ≈ 2.78% ｜ Interpretation: Healthy volatility conducive to orderly repair

**Pattern & Key Level Changes**

* Patterns: 10-12 bullish engulfing & 10-17 hammer still valid (near long-term support).  
* Key Levels: R1 (KC midline) and S1 (200-day MA) remain main watch.

**Macro Transmission Efficiency Changes**

* Yesterday: Data insufficient.  
* Today: MWI -1.8, SLP weekly ≈ +$0.7B, composite score -10 → transmission neutral-positive.  
* Impact: Confidence +10% (SMR/CUE) and -2% (short-term NL7 decoupling) net ≈ +8%.
