**In One Sentence**  
SOL is currently in multi-timeframe divergence: weekly prices remain above long-term moving averages (above 200-week), but the daily timeframe turned into a pullback since mid-October, with price consistently below the 20/50-day MAs, MACD histogram extending below the zero line, RSI(14) near the lower bound of neutral, and +DI/-DI showing bears in control. On the 4H chart, prices have slightly retaken the 20 MA but remain below the 50/200 MAs; OBV broke below the 9-period average, and short-term structure has yet to confirm an upward move. On the macro side, NL7 is significantly negative (-$44.3B) with a strong USD backdrop, stablecoins only slightly net increasing and capital usage efficiency negative, with weak transmission efficiency. Overall score is -28, labeled as consolidation, with the next step to watch if daily can reclaim R1 with volume recovery.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission Summary**  
MWI=-2.7 ‚Üí Macro tightening (score -3); NL7 at -$44.321B significantly negative (fiscal absorption dominant), stablecoins have only slightly net increased over the last 3 days (+$0.162B) and capital usage efficiency is negative; transmission efficiency score -3 shows on-chain capital failing to effectively support price, overall confidence remains medium in a consolidation environment.

## Technical Dimension Scoring
Weekly remains in long-term bullish structure (price above 200-week MA, MA20/50 above), but the last two weeks show +DI/-DI momentum weakening, ADX ~16 in a weak trend zone; daily has stayed below the 20/50-day MAs since the steep drop on 10-10, MACD histogram extending below zero, RSI(14) near lower neutral bound, +DI/-DI bears dominant; 4H short-term recovery near 20 MA but still below 50/200, OBV broke below 9-period MA, making reversal confirmation difficult. Momentum and MA systems drag scores down, while capital (daily CMF > 0) and healthy nATR provide some buffer.

| Dimension         | Score   | Key Evidence (threshold-based, may include specific values) |
| ----------------- | -------| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Price Structure & Patterns | -6/13 | Daily consistently below 20/50-day MA; bearish engulfing on 10-10 (Volume Ratio=2.31>1.3) ‚Üí -2; recent multiple breaks below critical levels (MA20/KC mid band) ‚Üí -4 |
| MA System         | -4/20  | Daily 20/50 death cross (above 200-day MA) ‚Üí -2; MA20<MA50 and price below both ‚Üí system weakening ‚Üí -2 |
| Momentum Indicators | -7/18 | MACD below zero and histogram extending (-3.19, below zero ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù) ‚Üí -5; RSI(14)=41.58 near lower neutral bound ‚Üí -2 |
| Capital Flow      | 0/15   | Daily up-move on lower volume (Volume Ratio=0.43) ‚Üí -5; CMF(21)=0.0901 > +0.05 inflow ‚Üí +5 |
| Trend Strength    | -3/10  | ADX(14)=23.34 (transitional) and -DI(26.76) > +DI(13.93) aligned with price direction ‚Üí -3 |
| Volatility & Position | +1/5 | 4H nATR=2.85% in healthy band; KC ‚Äúlower to mid band‚Äù ‚Üí +1 |
| Multi-timeframe Resonance | -3/7 | Weekly bullish bias, daily bearish bias; 4H failing to reclaim 50/200 MAs and OBV breakdown ‚Üí -3 |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Patterns: Daily pullback structure maintained after the large bearish candle on 10-10, with bearish engulfing and volume spike, followed by multiple closes below MA20 and KC mid band, bearish structure.  
* MA System: Daily 20/50 death cross formed, price below both, shifting from strong to weak; still above 200-day MA but recovery not yet seen.  
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero with histogram continuing, RSI(14) near lower neutral bound, bearish momentum but not extreme.  
* Capital Flow: Daily CMF > 0 shows capital inflow, but lower volume on up moves and weakening OBV limit price elasticity.  
* Trend Strength: ADX in 20‚Äì25 transitional zone, -DI leading and aligned with downtrend, trend not strong.  
* Volatility & Position: 4H volatility within healthy band, neutral position (lower to mid KC band), higher chance of reversion but lacking confirmation pattern.  
* Multi-timeframe Resonance: Weekly long-term bullish bias diverges from daily pullback; 4H not effectively repaired, short-term direction still uncertain.

**Conflict Explanation**: Weekly maintains long-term bullish structure, but daily and 4H have weakened; execution mainly follows daily as lead, with 4H used for timing confirmation. Treat as range-bound until R1 breakout.

## Risk Warnings

1. In weak-trend phases, false breakout risk is high; wait for close and volume confirmation.  
2. Macro-technical divergence (negative NL7 but weak stablecoin inflow), directional signals unclear.
