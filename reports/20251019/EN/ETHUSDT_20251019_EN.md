## Key Conclusions

* **Market Condition**: ⚪ Sideways
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ⚪ Range-bound Waiting for Confirmation
* **Confidence**: 60% ｜ **Composite Score**: -14/100
* **Status Badges**: ⚪ Weekly MA Bullish Structure ｜ 🔴 Daily Momentum Weakening ｜ ⚪ Volatility in Healthy Range

**One-Sentence Summary**  
Currently, ETH is in a sideways-to-weak pattern: the daily closed below the 20/50-day MAs but remains above the 200-day MA, MACD is below the zero line with contracting histogram, RSI(14) near the lower edge of the neutral zone; the weekly maintains a MA20>MA50>MA200 bullish structure (unclosed), ADX>25 indicates the trend is still structured; on 4H, price has returned above KC midline with nATR≈2.22% in healthy volatility. Macro-wise, MWI=-2.7 (tight bias), NL7 at -$44.32B with declining reserves, stablecoin SMR>8% but CUE significantly negative, transmission efficiency rating low (-5/10): macro tightening continues to pressure the market, daily momentum and capital need to improve synchronously.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission – One-Sentence Summary**  
MWI=-2.7 (tight bias) corresponds to macro liquidity score of -3; NL7=-$44.32B (7-day net withdrawal) with structural rise in TGA (fiscal draining reserves), small drop in RRP (marginal injection) but substantial drop in bank reserves; on stablecoin side, SMR=8.21% (ample) but CUE is significantly negative (poor capital use efficiency), weekly net increase insufficient (+$0.16B in past 3 days), transmission from macro → stablecoin → market is weak, short-term risk appetite pressured.

### Macro Liquidity Layer (Level & Structure)

| Indicator | Current Value | 7-Day Change | Structure/Definition Note | Impact Interpretation (Brief) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MWI | -2.7/10 | — | Tight bias | 🔴 Overall tightening, suppressing risk appetite |
| NL7($B) | -44.321 | — | Pulse negative | 🔴 Net capital withdrawal, suppressing risk assets |
| RRP($B) | 347.901 | -7.938 | Money market returning (injection) | ⚪ Marginally positive but weak |
| TGA($B) | 851.952 | +57.898 | Strong fiscal absorption (withdrawal) | 🔴 Draining reserves, pressuring market |
| Bank Reserves($B) | 2,988.202 | -45.653 | Buffer declining | 🔴 Bank risk appetite cooling |
| Central Bank Policy Bias | Hawkish/Neutral | — | Sticky inflation, limited rate-cut space | 🔴 Limited easing expectations |

### Transmission Bridge Layer (Efficiency & Synchronization)

| Indicator | Current Value | Judgment Threshold/Definition | Conclusion | Confidence Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stablecoin Supply SLP(7d,$B) | +0.162 (past 3 days) | >+1B moderate / <+0.5B weak/negative | ⚪ Weak inflow | ⚪ 0% (weekly insufficient) |
| Stablecoin Buffer SMR(%) | 8.21 | ≥8 ample / 6–8 normal / <6 tight | 🟢 Ample | ⚪ 0% |
| Capital Utilization CUE(%) | Significantly negative | >+5 efficient / ≈0 neutral / <-5 negative | 🔴 Negative efficiency | ⚪ 0% |
| Synchronization (NL7 vs SLP) | Negative vs weak positive | Smooth/decoupled/double-negative/reverse | 🔴 Decoupled/reverse weak | ⚪ 0% |

## Technical Dimension Scoring
Current weekly/daily/4H show “weekly bullish bias, daily weak, 4H recovering” misalignment: weekly holds bullish MA structure with ADX>25 trend background (but unclosed weekly candle, down-weighted scoring); daily below 20/50-day MA, MACD below zero with contracting histogram, RSI(14) near lower neutral bound, -DI dominant shows short-term pressure persists; 4H above KC midline, OBV above EMA9, MACD histogram turned positive, nATR≈2.22% in healthy band, short-term technical rebound possible but not yet aligned with daily.

| Dimension | Score | Key Evidence (threshold-based, may include values) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price Structure & Pattern | -2/13 | Daily below 20/50-day MA (ΔMA20=-7.87% / ΔMA50=-9.58%), above 200-day MA; last 20 candles show no effective engulfing/morning star reversal → -2 |
| MA System | +4/20 | Weekly MA20>MA50>MA200 with positive MA20 slope (unclosed, down-weighted); daily above 200-day MA → +4 |
| Momentum Indicators | -5/18 | Daily MACD below zero, histogram contracting (-44.08 vs prev -47.13); RSI(14)=41.50 near lower neutral → -5 |
| Capital Flow | -1/15 | Daily price up but volume ratio 0.41 (no volume expansion), OBV below EMA9, CMF(21)=0.107 (net inflow) → -1 |
| Trend Strength | -2/10 | Daily ADX=22.70 (transition zone), -DI>+DI (29.71>15.93) → -2 |
| Volatility & Position | +1/5 | 4H nATR≈2.22% in healthy band, above KC midline → +1 |
| Multi-Timeframe Confluence | -2/7 | Weekly bullish vs daily weak, 4H not yet back above its 200MA → -2 |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Pattern: Daily shows pullback “above 200-day MA but below 20/50-day MA,” no clear classic reversal in past 20 sessions, consolidation likely.
* MA System: Weekly MAs remain bullish (down-weighted); daily not bullish aligned but still above 200-day MA, long-term structure intact.
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero with negative histogram albeit contracting, RSI near lower neutral, momentum not in bull territory.
* Capital Flow: Volume not expanding, OBV below EMA9 but no new low; CMF positive showing net inflow, but inefficient conversion.
* Trend Strength: ADX at 20–25 transition zone, -DI dominates, trend signal weak—watch for +DI recovery.
* Volatility & Position: 4H volatility within healthy band, price above KC midline—technical reversion bias.
* Multi-Timeframe Confluence: Weekly bullish background but daily momentum misaligned; 4H recovery but not above timeframe’s 200MA—confluence lacking.

**Conflict Resolution**: When weekly bullish structure contradicts daily weak momentum, daily is execution priority; if 4H sustains above its MA50/MA20 with volume, alignment with daily will improve.

## Forward Scenarios

**Scenario ①: Continuation to the Upside**  
If technicals and funds marginally improve, price tends to revert toward daily midpoint.

| Factor | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | 35% |
| Expected Window | 3–5 days |
| Trigger (Technical) | If: daily close > R1 (3903.88) and 4H OBV above EMA9 and holds; MACD histogram contracts to positive (D) |
| Trigger (Macro) | If: SLP7d > +$1B or DXY falls below key MA |
| Target/Range | 4130–4220 (Daily KC midline to 20-day MA) |
| Invalidation | 4H close < 4H MA20 or daily drops below 3820 with worsening volume-price divergence |

**Scenario ②: Range-bound Consolidation**  
Holding below daily midpoint, waiting for direction confirmation.

| Factor | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | 45% |
| Expected Window | 1–2 weeks |
| Trigger (Technical) | If: S1 (3745) < daily close < R2 (4131) and ADX(14) < 25 |
| Trigger (Macro) | No strong macro triggers (MWI weak negative, transmission unchanged) |
| Target/Range | 3745–4131 (4H KC lower band to daily KC midline) |
| Invalidation | Break above R2 with volume expansion or break below S1 with sustained -DI dominance |

**Scenario ③: Weakening Pullback**  
If technical recovery fails and funds weaken again, price may test lower supports.

| Factor | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | 20% |
| Expected Window | 2–3 days |
| Trigger (Technical) | If: 4H close < 4H MA50 (≈3957.83) and MACD histogram remains negative (H4); daily -DI and ADX rise together |
| Trigger (Macro) | If: SLP weakens or DXY strengthens further |
| Target/Range | 3590–3745 (Daily/4H lower band zone) |
| Invalidation | 4H close > 4H MA20 and OBV>EMA9 sustained ｜ daily holds R2 (4131)

---

## Risk Warnings

1. In weak trend phases, false breakout risk is high—confirm with volume and capital flow.  
2. Macro-technical divergence: marginal stablecoin inflow not effectively translating into spot net buying.

## Monitoring Checklist (For Next Day/Session Review)

- **Volatility**: Whether H4 nATR stays in 1–3% healthy range (current: 2.22% → ⚪ Healthy).  
- **Momentum**: Whether daily RSI(14) exits 40–60 neutral (current: 41.50 → ⚪ Neutral-weak); MACD zero/histogram (current: below zero/contracting → 🔴 Bearish bias).  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs EMA9 (above), check if price-volume aligned.  
- **MA Structure**: Daily ΔMA20/50/200 expanding/contracting (-7.87%/-9.58%/+22.31%).  
- **Key Levels**: Watch if S1/R1 triggers and invalidation conditions met.
