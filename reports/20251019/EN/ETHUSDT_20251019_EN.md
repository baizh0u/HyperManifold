**One-Sentence Summary**  
Currently, ETH is in a sideways-to-weak pattern: the daily closed below the 20/50-day MAs but remains above the 200-day MA, MACD is below the zero line with contracting histogram, RSI(14) near the lower edge of the neutral zone; the weekly maintains a MA20>MA50>MA200 bullish structure (unclosed), ADX>25 indicates the trend is still structured; on 4H, price has returned above KC midline with nATR‚âà2.22% in healthy volatility. Macro-wise, MWI=-2.7 (tight bias), NL7 at -$44.32B with declining reserves, stablecoin SMR>8% but CUE significantly negative, transmission efficiency rating low (-5/10): macro tightening continues to pressure the market, daily momentum and capital need to improve synchronously.

## Technical Dimension Scoring
Current weekly/daily/4H show ‚Äúweekly bullish bias, daily weak, 4H recovering‚Äù misalignment: weekly holds bullish MA structure with ADX>25 trend background (but unclosed weekly candle, down-weighted scoring); daily below 20/50-day MA, MACD below zero with contracting histogram, RSI(14) near lower neutral bound, -DI dominant shows short-term pressure persists; 4H above KC midline, OBV above EMA9, MACD histogram turned positive, nATR‚âà2.22% in healthy band, short-term technical rebound possible but not yet aligned with daily.

| Dimension | Score | Key Evidence (threshold-based, may include values) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price Structure & Pattern | -2/13 | Daily below 20/50-day MA (ŒîMA20=-7.87% / ŒîMA50=-9.58%), above 200-day MA; last 20 candles show no effective engulfing/morning star reversal ‚Üí -2 |
| MA System | +4/20 | Weekly MA20>MA50>MA200 with positive MA20 slope (unclosed, down-weighted); daily above 200-day MA ‚Üí +4 |
| Momentum Indicators | -5/18 | Daily MACD below zero, histogram contracting (-44.08 vs prev -47.13); RSI(14)=41.50 near lower neutral ‚Üí -5 |
| Capital Flow | -1/15 | Daily price up but volume ratio 0.41 (no volume expansion), OBV below EMA9, CMF(21)=0.107 (net inflow) ‚Üí -1 |
| Trend Strength | -2/10 | Daily ADX=22.70 (transition zone), -DI>+DI (29.71>15.93) ‚Üí -2 |
| Volatility & Position | +1/5 | 4H nATR‚âà2.22% in healthy band, above KC midline ‚Üí +1 |
| Multi-Timeframe Confluence | -2/7 | Weekly bullish vs daily weak, 4H not yet back above its 200MA ‚Üí -2 |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Pattern: Daily shows pullback ‚Äúabove 200-day MA but below 20/50-day MA,‚Äù no clear classic reversal in past 20 sessions, consolidation likely.
* MA System: Weekly MAs remain bullish (down-weighted); daily not bullish aligned but still above 200-day MA, long-term structure intact.
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero with negative histogram albeit contracting, RSI near lower neutral, momentum not in bull territory.
* Capital Flow: Volume not expanding, OBV below EMA9 but no new low; CMF positive showing net inflow, but inefficient conversion.
* Trend Strength: ADX at 20‚Äì25 transition zone, -DI dominates, trend signal weak‚Äîwatch for +DI recovery.
* Volatility & Position: 4H volatility within healthy band, price above KC midline‚Äîtechnical reversion bias.
* Multi-Timeframe Confluence: Weekly bullish background but daily momentum misaligned; 4H recovery but not above timeframe‚Äôs 200MA‚Äîconfluence lacking.

**Conflict Resolution**: When weekly bullish structure contradicts daily weak momentum, daily is execution priority; if 4H sustains above its MA50/MA20 with volume, alignment with daily will improve.

## Risk Warnings

1. In weak trend phases, false breakout risk is high‚Äîconfirm with volume and capital flow.  
2. Macro-technical divergence: marginal stablecoin inflow not effectively translating into spot net buying.
