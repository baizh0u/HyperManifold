## Core Conclusion

* **Market Condition**: ⚪ Range-bound
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ⚪ Waiting for Range Confirmation
* **Confidence Level**: 72% ｜ **Composite Score**: -16/100
* **Status Badges**: 🔴 Weak Momentum 🔴 Insufficient Trend Strength ⚪ Neutral Capital Flow

**One Sentence Summary**  
Daily ETH closed below the 20/50-day MAs and above the 200-day MA, with MACD below the zero line and expanding histogram; RSI(14) sits in the lower neutral band; trend strength (ADX≈22.7) is below a clear trend threshold. On the 4H timeframe, price rebounded above the KC midline but remains below the 50/200 MAs, indicating a weak rebound structure. Weekly remains above major MAs but momentum is weakening. Macro MWI=-1.8 (tight), NL7 mean +25.25B contrasted with spot -44.32B divergence; slow net inflow in stablecoins and SMR>8% provide some cushion, but in the short term more sensitive to spot liquidity drain; transmission efficiency is mildly positive.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission - One Sentence Summary**  
MWI=-1.8 (tight), NL7 mean positive (+25.25B) but weekend spot significantly negative (-44.32B); stablecoins up slightly in the past 3 days (≈+$0.30B, weekly ≈+$0.7B), SMR≈8.14% ample, CUE≈18.3% efficient. Bridge quality is good but short-term is sensitive to spot liquidity drain. Transmission efficiency mildly positive. Overall macro confidence impact is neutral to slightly positive.

## Technical Dimension Scoring
ETH weekly still above major MAs but momentum weakening; daily above 200-day MA yet below 20/50-day MAs with declining slope, MACD below zero and expanding histogram, RSI(14) in lower neutral band, trend strength below threshold; 4H back above KC midline, OBV above its 9-period MA, positive capital flow, but still below 50/200 MAs—rebound needs confirmation.

| Dimension            | Score  | Key Evidence (Threshold-based, may include specific values)                  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Price Structure      | -3/13  | Daily closed below KC midline (KC midline=4131.17, close=3889.21) and below 20/50-day MAs → Bearish structure |
| MA System            | -2/20  | Daily MA20<MA50, price above 200-day MA but short-term MA20 slope is negative (last 7 periods) → Weak MAs |
| Momentum Indicators  | -8/18  | MACD below zero and expanding (hist=-44.08), RSI(14)=41.5 lower neutral → Weak momentum |
| Capital Flow         | 0/15   | Daily CMF(21)=+0.107>+0.05 but dropping last 2 days, OBV below 9-period MA → Neutral |
| Trend Strength       | -3/10  | ADX(14)=22.7<25, -DI>+DI matching short-term downward → Lack of trend |
| Volatility & Position| +1/5   | H4 nATR≈2.22% within healthy band, price between KC midline and upper band → Neutral to slightly bullish |
| Multi-Timeframe Sync | -2/7   | Daily weak while 4H rebound still below local 50/200 MAs → Non-aligned cycles |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure: Daily candles below KC midline for multiple days—short-term structure weak; last 20 candles lack a classic reversal, still oscillating within range.
* MA System: MA20<MA50 with MA20 slope turning negative; although above 200-day MA, short-term MA pressure is apparent.
* Momentum Indicators: MACD below zero with expanding histogram shows downward momentum remains; RSI(14) in neutral band but toward lower side—momentum lacking.
* Capital Flow: CMF positive but weakening, daily OBV below its 9-period MA—funds less convincing.
* Trend Strength: ADX below 25, +DI/-DI suggests weak or transitional trend—no “organized” trend signal yet.
* Volatility & Position: H4 volatility in healthy range with price above KC midline—short-term repair attempt after midline return.
* Multi-Timeframe Sync: Weekly mildly bullish but momentum weakened, daily weak, 4H rebound still capped by critical MAs—no bullish alignment.

**Conflict Explanation**: Daily weakness vs 4H rebound—execution should be daily-led, with 4H as timing reference only; failure to climb above 4H 50/200 MAs limits rebound confirmation.

## Price Level & Relative Distance (Based on last_closed)

- **Close vs MA20/50/200 (D, last_closed)**:  
  Above 200-day MA, below 20/50-day MAs; deviations: -7.87% / -9.58% / +22.31%.
- **KC Position (H4, last_closed)**:  
  Midline to upper band (Interpretation: Outside = overextended; near midline = higher reversion probability).
- **Support/Resistance Heatmap (Daily focus)**:  
  S1=3819 (recent daily swing low) ~1.80% from close ｜ S2=3592 (daily KC lower band) ~7.63% ｜ S3=3179 (200-day MA) ~18.25%;  
  R1=4131 (daily KC midline) ~6.22% ｜ R2=4221 (20-day MA) ~8.54% ｜ R3=4301 (50-day MA) ~10.59%.

## Future Scenario Analysis

**Scenario ①: Continued Upside**  
If daily closes above R1 (KC midline) with MACD histogram contracting and 4H OBV above its 9-period MA, price likely repairs up toward MA cluster.

**Scenario ②: Range Consolidation**  
Oscillating between S1 and R1, trend strength lacking (ADX<25), neutral range.

## Risk Warnings

1. In weak trend phases, false breakout risk is high—wait for key level close confirmation.
2. Disagreement between macro and technicals (NL7 mean diverges from spot) — short-term signals indecisive.

## Watchlist 

- **Volatility**: H4 nATR stay in 1–3% healthy range? (Current: 2.22% → ⚪ Healthy)  
- **Momentum**: Daily RSI(14) leave 40–60 neutral? (Current: 41.50 → ⚪ Neutral); MACD zero/hist (Current: below zero / expanding → 🔴 Bearish)  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs EMA9 relationship (above), check price-volume alignment  
- **MA Structure**: Daily ΔMA20/50/200 expansion/contraction (-7.87%/-9.58%/+22.31%)  
- **Key Levels**: Watch if S1/R1 trigger/invalidation conditions are met
