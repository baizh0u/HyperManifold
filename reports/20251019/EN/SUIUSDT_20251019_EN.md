## Core Conclusion

* **Market Status**: 🔴 Bearish  
* **Market Bias (For Reference)**: 🔴 Rebound Bias Bearish  
* **Confidence**: 63% ｜ **Composite Score**: -41/100  
* **Status Badges**: 🔴 Strong Trend (ADX>25) ｜ 🔴 Below Three Moving Averages ｜ ⚪ Neutral Capital Flow ｜ ⚪ High Volatility  

**One-sentence Summary**  
Recently, the daily close is below all three major moving averages, trend strength (ADX ≈ 41.8) is rising significantly, MACD is below zero with widening histogram, RSI14 ≈ 34 in weak zone, indicating continuation of the downtrend. On the 4H, price remains below its moving averages, but OBV is above its moving average and CMF is positive — indicating short-term technical rebound attempts. On the macro side, net liquidity pulse NL7 = -$44.3B (strong TGA absorption, slight RRP release), MWI = -2.7 (tight), stablecoin supply shows slight net increase over the past 3 days but coexists with negative pulse, transmission efficiency is weak, overall macro tone remains bearish.

## Macro Environment Analysis

**Macro Transmission One-sentence Summary**  
MWI = -2.7 (tight), NL7 = -$44.3B (RRP down but TGA strong absorption, reserves falling), stablecoins have small net increase (~+$0.16B) over the last 3 days while price declines; capital use efficiency clearly negative, transmission decoupled and lagging. Strong USD index (121.52) suppressing risk appetite, overall bearish for the market and reducing confidence.

## Technical Dimension Scoring

Daily and weekly both show prices below major MAs, strong trend signal (ADX>25 and rising), MACD below zero with expanding hist, RSI in weak zone. 4H still below its MAs but OBV above its MA and CMF positive — short-term rebound intent present; overall multi-timeframe bearish alignment.

| Dimension       | Score   | Key Evidence (Thresholds, may include figures)                         |
| -------         | ------  | -------------------------------------------                             |
| Price Structure & Pattern | -2/13  | Daily closed below MA20/MA50/MA200; bullish engulfing on 10-12 with volume ratio 1.73 → +2, overall bias still bearish |
| MA System       | -8/20  | Daily price below all 3 MAs (ΔMA20 ≈ -19.76%, ΔMA50 ≈ -24.70%, ΔMA200 ≈ -24.02%) |
| Momentum        | -9/18  | MACD below zero axis and expanding hist; RSI14=34.6 in weak zone (below 40–60 neutral) |
| Capital Flow    | -3/15  | Daily falling volume (10-17 vol ratio ≈ 1.49) → -5; OBV below MA → -3; CMF21=0.12 and rising → +5 |
| Trend Strength  | -10/10 | ADX ≈ 41.8 > 25 and rising, -DI dominant consistent with price move (clear bearish trend) |
| Volatility & Position | -2/5   | H4 nATR ≈ 3.48% above healthy zone, KC in lower to mid band (high vol, neutral position) |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance | -4/7   | Weekly/Daily bearish, H4 still under MA200, rebound failed to reclaim key MAs |

**Dimension Analysis**

* Price Structure & Pattern: Daily continues below three MAs, bearish structure; bullish engulfing on 10-12 (vol ratio >1.3) shows short-term repair signal but fails to reclaim mid band — limited impact.
* MA System: Daily deviations from MAs are significant (~-19.8%, -24.7%, -24.0%), mid-term pressure strong, clear MA bearish advantage.
* Momentum: MACD below zero axis with expanding histogram, downward momentum; RSI14 in weak zone.
* Capital Flow: OBV below its MA, but CMF > +0.05 and rising — weak price-volume coordination with offsetting inflow effect.
* Trend Strength: ADX well above 25 and rising, "organized" bearish trend, strong downward inertia.
* Volatility & Position: H4 vol slightly above healthy zone, price in KC lower/mid bands, unstable environment, high chase/drop risk.
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Weekly/Daily bearish and H4 execution layer still below key MAs, good bearish alignment.

**Conflict Explanation**: 4H shows local improvement in capital and momentum (OBV > EMA9, MACD hist positive), but under strong Weekly/Daily bearish trend pressure, this is only short-term rebound, not changing mid-term bearish bias.

## Price Levels & Relative Distance (Based on last_closed)

- **Close vs MA20/50/200 (Daily, last_closed)**:  
  Price below 20-day/50-day/200-day MAs; deviations: -19.76% / -24.70% / -24.02%.
- **KC Position (H4, last_closed)**:  
  Lower band to mid band (interpretation: outside = over-extension; near mid band = higher reversion probability).
- **Support/Resistance Heatmap (Daily focus)**:  
  • S1 ≈ 2.3766 (4H KC lower band, recent dynamic support) ｜ Distance ≈ 4.98%  
  • S2 ≈ 2.2687 (Daily KC lower band) ｜ Distance ≈ 9.29%  
  • S3 ≈ 2.2804 (Recent daily swing low 10-17) ｜ Distance ≈ 8.82%  
  • R1 ≈ 2.9608 (Daily KC mid band) ｜ Distance ≈ 18.37%  
  • R2 ≈ 3.1166 (20-day MA) ｜ Distance ≈ 24.59%  
  • R3 ≈ 3.3237 (50-day MA) ｜ Distance ≈ 32.89%

## Future Scenario Analysis

**Scenario①: Continuation Upward**  
If daily closes above R1 (Daily KC mid band ≈ 2.9608) and 4H OBV stays above its EMA9 and 4H MACD hist remains positive, price may recover towards 3.12–3.32 (20-day/50-day MA zone).

## Risk Warnings

1. Technical rebounds during weak trend stages are prone to strong trend suppression — high false breakout risk.  
2. Macro and on-chain transmission decoupled (NL7 negative but stablecoins mildly increasing), reducing directional confidence.

---

## Watchlist (For Next Day/Session Review)

- **Volatility**: Check if H4 nATR stays in 1–3% healthy zone (Current: 3.48% → ⚪ High).  
- **Momentum**: Check if Daily RSI14 exits 40–60 neutral zone (Current: 34.58 → 🔴 Weak); MACD zero axis & hist status (Current: below zero/expanding → 🔴 Bearish).  
- **Volume**: H4 OBV vs EMA9 relation (above), check if price-volume align.  
- **MA Structure**: Monitor Daily ΔMA20/50/200 expansion (Current: -19.76/-24.70/-24.02).  
- **Key Levels**: Watch triggers/invalidation conditions for S1/R1.
