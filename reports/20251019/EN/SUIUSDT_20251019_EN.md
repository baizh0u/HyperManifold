## Core Conclusions

* **Market Condition**: ‚ö™ Range-bound
* **Market Bias (For Reference Only)**: ‚ö™ Waiting for Range Confirmation
* **Confidence**: 54% ÔΩú **Composite Score**: -9/100
* **Status Badges**: üî¥ Strong Trend (Daily ADX>40) ÔΩú üü¢ Capital Inflow (CMF>0) ÔΩú ‚ö™ High Volatility (H4 nATR>3%)

**One-Sentence Summary**  
Daily price is significantly below the 20/50/200-day moving averages (about -19.75% deviation from the 20-day MA), MACD is below the zero line with expanding histogram, RSI(14)=34.58 in weak zone, indicating strong downtrend (ADX=41.79, -DI dominant). However, marginal improvement in capital inflow is observed (CMF21‚âà+0.12), 4H short-term rebound to KC channel mid-to-upper range, OBV above its 9-period MA, with higher volatility (nATR‚âà3.54%). On macro level, MWI=-1.8 (tight bias), NL7 is negative, but weekly net stablecoin supply is around +$0.7B (offsetting effect). Transmission efficiency is overall +5/10 but short-term pressure remains; overall forms a range-bound tag.

## Macro Environment Analysis

## Technical Dimension Scoring

Daily and weekly both point bearish: Daily price significantly below 200-day MA, near-term 20/50-day MAs trending down; MACD below zero line with expanding histogram, RSI in weak zone; CMF>0 shows marginal inflow but OBV not yet repaired; trend strength high (ADX>40, -DI dominant), 4H short-term rebound above KC mid-band but still below MA50/200, overall aligned with daily bearish bias, forming a down-biased range-bound structure.

| Dimension      | Score     | Key Evidence (Threshold-based, may include exact values)                         |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Price Structure & Patterns | -7/13 | Daily below 200-day MA with near-term 20/50 MAs sloping down; last 2 breaks below key levels (MA20 & KC mid-band) ‚Üí -4; recent shape lacks clear patterns ‚Üí 0; Price below MAs trending down ‚Üí -3 |
| MA System    | 0/20 | No ‚Äúbullish/bearish alignment‚Äù and 200-day MA flat to slightly up; no near-term 20/50 golden/death cross ‚Üí 0 |
| Momentum    | -5/18 | MACD below zero with expanding hist (-0.075, expanding) ‚Üí -5; RSI14=34.58 (weak zone) ‚Üí 0 |
| Capital Flow    | 0/15 | Up on low volume (Vol ratio‚âà0.37) ‚Üí -5; CMF21=+0.1217 rising ‚Üí +5; OBV below 9-period MA (no new low) ‚Üí 0 |
| Trend Strength    | +10/10 | ADX=41.79>25 and strengthening ‚Üí +6; -DI dominant aligned with downtrend ‚Üí +4 |
| Volatility & Position  | 0/5  | H4 nATR‚âà3.54% above healthy band; KC mid-to-upper (not outside extension) ‚Üí 0 |
| Multi-Timeframe Resonance   | -5/7  | Weekly/Daily bearish, 4H below MA200, rebound fails to breach MA50 ‚Üí -5 |

**Dimension Interpretation**

* Price Structure & Patterns: Daily price under all major MAs, near-term 20/50 MAs sloping down; key levels (MA20, KC mid-band) not reclaimed in last two closes, structure bearish. No clear classical candlestick pattern, in consolidating downtrend.
* MA System: No ‚Äúbearish alignment‚Äù (20<50<200) and 200-day MA flat/slightly up, MA system neutral score.
* Momentum: MACD below zero with expanding hist, bearish momentum; RSI(14) in weak zone, not yet extreme oversold.
* Capital Flow: Up-day but low volume (vol ratio‚âà0.37), mismatched with trend; CMF positive indicates marginal inflow, OBV still below MA not repaired.
* Trend Strength: ADX>40, strong trend phase, -DI dominant aligned with downtrend.
* Volatility & Position: 4H volatility above healthy range, price at KC mid-to-upper band, short-term rebound but no upper-band breakout.
* Multi-Timeframe Resonance: Weekly/Daily bearish, 4H still below MA200, rebound fails MA50, bearish resonance in HTF alignment.

**Conflict Note**: Capital (CMF>0) vs Momentum/Structure (bearish) divergence; prioritize HTF (daily) bearish, 4H rebound seen as repair not reversal.

## Future Scenario Analysis

**Scenario ‚ë†: Continued Downside**  
Strong bearish trend; if short-term rebound lacks momentum, may retest lower supports.

## Risk Alerts

1. Weak phase with strong trend, high risk of false rebounds and swift pullbacks (high ADX).
2. Macro and technical divergence (CMF inflow vs bearish momentum), directional confirmation needs key level and volume observation.
